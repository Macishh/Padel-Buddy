# Padel Buddy
A project in TDA367 objectoriented programming project at Chalmers University of Technology.
* Using Java 8 and Gradle for automated building

## Introduction
Padel is a racquet sport and is typically seen as a combination of squash and tennis. It is played in doubles on a court that is a third the size of a tennis court. The court has walls which allows the ball to be played against them in a similar way as squash. Padel uses stringless racquets and almost the same balls as tennis. Scoring is the same as normal tennis. Since padel requires four people to play, the project aims to create an app to find opponents in Padel with a specific skill-level and decide where/when to play against each other. The purpose is to facilitate to find opponents, and automate the process of regulation for place and time.
